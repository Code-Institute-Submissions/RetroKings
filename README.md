## The Idea

This Milestone project creation is the culmination of learning and study from all modules of the Full Stack Developer Course from Code Institute, culminating in the creation of this Full Stack Framework Django project. For this project i decided to build an e-commerce store that allows an admin to store and manipulate data records and also allows them to create, read, update & delete items from the store. 

RetroKings is your one stop shop for all retro Soccer, NBA, NFL & MLB jerseys.

To test the website's checkout functionality, use the following payment credentials:

- <strong>Card number:</strong> 4242 4242 4242 4242
- <strong>Expiry date:</strong> Any date in the future
- <strong>CV2 number:</strong> Any 3 digits
- <strong>ZIP:</strong> 42424

The design process is the one i enjoy the most. I enjoy learning new ways to style my projects and I feel more and more that Front End Development in particular the design aspects of it is my calling in this profession. I have enjoyed designing all of my projects but this is the one i have enjoyed the most as i have really seen over the course how i have improved in this aspect. I have tried to take on new challenges in all of my milestone projects and not be repetitive when it has come to the design of each one. 
I enjoy it all from deciding on the colour schemes to the layouts of the pages etc, and i really feel this is how you entice the user and convince him to browse your site.

### Font

The main font i chose for this site was 'Old Standard TT' from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Old+Standard+TT?preview.text=Retro%20Kings&preview.text_type=custom&query=old+#standard-styles) In keeping with the theme of the site Old Standard reproduces a specific type of Modern (classicist) style of serif typefaces, It keeps in line to the type of vintage/classic products we have on offer. The font is clear with clean lines and reads well.

'Sans-Serif' is used as the default backup font in cases where these fonts have difficulty loading. 

### Colour Scheme

To help me choose my color scheme i used [Adobe Color Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel).

This process took a long time during the wireframe stage. In the end i decided on this color scheme as it is quite vivid and bright. The gold gives it a very vivid feel and helps to highlight important points against the white backdrop and at the same time it gives the website a bold feel with the added contrast of the color black. I also used white with a mix of a gold gradient to just break the page up from being a standard white background on certain areas such as products cards, FAQ page etc.

Three primary colors were chosen when creating this project:

- ![#d4af37](https://placehold.it/15/d4af37/000000?text=+) `#d4af37` 
- ![#000000](https://placehold.it/15/000000/000000?text=+) `#000000` 
- ![#ffffff](https://placehold.it/15/ffffff/000000?text=+) `#ffffff`

The three colours are featured heavily across the site.

The navbar header is colored in ![#ffffff](https://placehold.it/15/ffffff/000000?text=+) `#ffffff`, which offered a bright background to the logo and the searchbar. I used 
![#000000](https://placehold.it/15/000000/000000?text=+) `#000000` to highlight the nav-links i surround them by a background of ![#d4af37](https://placehold.it/15/d4af37/000000?text=+) `#d4af37` and also to break up the navbar from the top nav header.

The call to action buttons utilised the same navbar coloring of ![#d4af37](https://placehold.it/15/d4af37/000000?text=+) `#d4af37` as their background with a font color of 
![#000000](https://placehold.it/15/000000/000000?text=+) `#000000` where there is two buttons in view on the same page to highlight the different buttons i reveresed this procedure. When active, focused or hovered on the primary colour buttons of ![#d4af37](https://placehold.it/15/d4af37/000000?text=+) `#d4af37` with ![#000000](https://placehold.it/15/000000/000000?text=+) `#000000` font the main background color of the button was set to reverse of ![#000000](https://placehold.it/15/000000/000000?text=+) `#000000` with ![#d4af37](https://placehold.it/15/d4af37/000000?text=+) `#d4af37` font. The secondary colour buttons of ![#000000](https://placehold.it/15/000000/000000?text=+) `#000000` with ![#d4af37](https://placehold.it/15/d4af37/000000?text=+) `#d4af37` font when active, focused or hovered have been set to ![#ffffff](https://placehold.it/15/ffffff/000000?text=+) `#ffffff` with the font inside being set to ![#d4af37](https://placehold.it/15/d4af37/000000?text=+) `#d4af37` to show the user that this element is interact-able and something will happen when pressed.

To give the website a more colorful feel & to create a better visual experience for the user i added a subtle gradient effect to pages like the products page & the FAQ page etc using white to begin with and then adding the gradient effect working its way into gold.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
